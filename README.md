Made for a Raspberry Pi (I think it was a "2"). Let's you collect "Colored Squares" (generally a set of Inputs), usable for e.g. a collection game.

-> Attach it some "Signal Source" (e.g. Buttons)
   -> Initially it was used with a driving Robot, which had to autonomously drive to "Production Stations".
   -> There it performed some Operation and received one "Block" for each successfully achieved result
   -> After receiving all (and every one exactly only one time) it drove to it's "Home" to report one finished production cycle and started over

It additionally comes with "shield attached" touchscreen support for debugging intervention
